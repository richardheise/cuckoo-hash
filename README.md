# Cuckoo Hashing

The cuckoo hashing algorithm is a well-known hashing strategy used usually in popular commercial databases.
This repo is an example of a simple cuckoo hash without rehashing.

Use 

```bash
./execTests.sh
```

To run every test in the tests/ dir. There reulsts are then write into results/ dir and a diff is made between each result and each input.

In summary, we got tests :)
